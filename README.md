Welcome to openFPGA-tutorials!

The goal is to put all the information and resources I've gathered along the way while learning **Verilog** and the **openFPGA** platform for my [**Project Freedom**](https://didier.malenfant.net/ProjectFreedom/) fantasy console. The info is out there but it's scattered across many sites, some of them hidden behind a walled garden. This will hopefully put it all in one place, alongside some code and tools that could help people get started.

A lot of the information found here was sourced in the many resources listed at the end of the [wiki](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/wiki).

This will be an evolving project as things get refined, added, fixed.

Feel free to join in the [discussions](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/discussions) if you have any questions or want some help or file an [issue](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/issues) if you find any errors or omissions in the [wiki](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/wiki) or the sample code.

üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ Happy learning!
